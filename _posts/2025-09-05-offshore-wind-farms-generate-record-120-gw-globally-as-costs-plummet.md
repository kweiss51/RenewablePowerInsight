The global offshore wind industry reached a historic milestone in 2025, with total installed capacity surpassing 120 gigawatts (GW) worldwide. This represents a 45% increase from the previous year, driven by technological advances, cost reductions, and supportive government policies across major markets.

## Record-Breaking Year

The offshore wind sector experienced unprecedented growth in 2025:

- **New Installations**: 35 GW of new offshore wind capacity commissioned
- **Cost Reduction**: Average levelized costs fell 25% year-over-year
- **Turbine Size**: New installations featured turbines averaging 12-15 MW capacity
- **Investment**: $180 billion in global offshore wind investments

## Technology Drivers

Several technological breakthroughs enabled this rapid expansion:

### Larger, More Efficient Turbines
Modern offshore wind turbines now feature:
- Rotor diameters exceeding 200 meters
- Hub heights reaching 150 meters above sea level
- Capacity factors averaging 55-65% in optimal locations
- Advanced blade designs optimized for marine environments

### Floating Platform Innovation
Floating offshore wind technology matured significantly:
- Commercial-scale floating wind farms entered operation
- Hybrid floating platforms combining wind and solar generation
